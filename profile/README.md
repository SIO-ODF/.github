## Hi there, we're the ODF 👋

<!--

**Here are some ideas to get you started:**

🙋‍♀️ A short introduction - what is your organization all about?
🌈 Contribution guidelines - how can the community get involved?
👩‍💻 Useful resources - where can the community find your docs? Is there anything else the community should know?
🍿 Fun facts - what does your team eat for breakfast?
🧙 Remember, you can do mighty things with the power of [Markdown](https://docs.github.com/github/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax)

This is the organizational page for the [Oceanographic Data Facility](https://scripps.ucsd.edu/ships/shipboard-technical-support/odf), working as a part of [Shipboard Technical Support](https://scripps.ucsd.edu/ships/shipboard-technical-support) at the [Scripps Institution of Oceanography](https://scripps.ucsd.edu/) in San Diego, California.

Here, we maintain a handful of repositories for sailing at sea. These have been mostly developed for the international [GO-SHIP program](https://www.go-ship.org/), though ODF does work with other projects as well.

Please reach out to us if you're interested in collaborating or contributing to our projects. We specialize in:
* Science Operations and Data Quality Control
* CTD data processing
* Chemistry, particularly common nutrients and dissolved oxygen
* Marine electronics and mechanincal development
